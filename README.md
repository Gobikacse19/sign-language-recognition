# sign-language-recognition
This repository contains the implementation of a Sign Language Recognition System based on hand gestures. The system is designed to recognize various signs in sign language using computer vision techniques and machine learning algorithms.

Overview
Sign language is a crucial means of communication for individuals with hearing impairments. However, the communication barrier between individuals who understand sign language and those who don't can be challenging. This system aims to bridge this gap by enabling real-time recognition of sign language gestures, allowing for better communication between individuals who use sign language and those who do not.

Features
Real-time hand gesture detection and recognition.
Support for a wide range of sign language gestures.
Accuracy and efficiency optimized through machine learning algorithms.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction.
Flexibility to integrate with different platforms and devices.

Installation
To use the Sign Language Recognition System, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/gobikacse19/sign-language-recognition.git

Install dependencies:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Run the system:
python main.py
